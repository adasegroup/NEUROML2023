## Course description:
This course is specifically aimed at MSc and PhD students with basic knowledge of Machine Learning techniques pursuing further growth in neuroimaging data analysis, either in clinical practice or in neuroscience research. The course will provide you with training in the aspects of human neuroimaging methods, data properties and applied Machine Learning techniques. The course is focused on brain biophysics, scanning techniques and methods of data analysis. Students will develop a broad set of skills that are essential to study brain function, brain pathology and solve biomedical tasks with state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Computer Vision techniques.​


### The list of the current seminars published (will be updated with time):

  **Note**: To Follow seminar you will need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and supplementary data downloaded
  1) Install Docker;
  2) Download `NEUROML-data.zip` from [YaDisk](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/xxnRbLetEh07YQ) and unzip it to local directory;
  3) Clone repository to your local machine;
  4) Run docker locally and ensure it working with command `docker run hello-world`;
  5) In terminal: `cd NEUROML2022/seminar2`
  6) Type command `docker build -t neuroml/seminar2:0.0.1 .` and wait for successfull build (the dot . is importaint)
  7) Run `docker run --rm -it -v /directory/to/downloaded/data/on/step/2:/workspace/data -p 8080:8080 neuroml/seminar2:0.0.1`;\
     **Note**: If you have *Windows*, pay attention to paths, type paths in conventional powershell script `C:\directory\to\downloaded\data\on\step\2`
  8) Open browser (preferebly Chrome) -> localhost:8080
